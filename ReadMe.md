# 3D Boid Simulation (C++ & Unreal Engine 5)

## For this university project, I developed a 3D Boid Simulation in Unreal Engine 5 using C++, implementing steering and flocking behavior AI. The project required both a functional simulation and a detailed code report based on a provided template.

### Features:
🗺️ Maps – Different environments for the boid simulation.<br/>
