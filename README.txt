# 3D Boid Simulation (C++ & Unreal Engine 5)

## For this university project, I developed a 3D Boid Simulation in Unreal Engine 5 using C++, implementing steering and flocking behavior AI. The project required both a functional simulation and a detailed code report based on a provided template.

## Features:
🗺️ Maps – Different environments for the boid simulation.<br/>

🏗️ Flock Customization – Adjust boid behavior and parameters.<br/>
🖱️ Attraction/Repulsion from Mouse – Interact with boids using cursor input.<br/>
📦 Bounding Volume – Keeps boids within a defined simulation space.<br/>
🚧 Obstacle Spawning – Dynamic obstacles for boids to navigate around.<br/>
